# IndiStuff

This is where I store any Indi stuff, Indi being a most excellent system for controlling/using astronomoical kit remotely.

The only thing here at the moment is my focus driver for Indi, which is for the Hummingboard 2 platform using a stepper motor driver chip and a Moonlight Focusers stepper motor rig.
